<!--    Blocks is so you dont have to write the same html code over again -->
<!--    as here you get the same page as base.html but you blocked the content
        This way you can change the name content in another file by blocking it -->

{% extends "base.html" %}
{% block title %}Home page{% endblock %}
{% block content %}
<h1>Test</h1>
{% for car in cars %}
    <h3>{{car}}</h3>
{% endfor %}

<!-- to get the first item in the array -->
<h3>{{cars.1}}</h3>
{% endblock %}
